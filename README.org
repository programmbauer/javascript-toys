* mandelbrot.html
This file contains a naive visualization of the Mandelbrot set. You can open the file and hit the Play button to see a zoom flight through the visualization at an "impressive" 200x200 pixels and ~ 13 fps. You can edit various variables in the file to change the resolution, update rate and position of the rendered view. Additionally you can familiarize yourself with the ~recordAnimation~ and ~playAnimation~ function to render frames ahead of time and produce animations like the example below:

* JavascriptConsole.html
This is a minimalistic javascript REPL (using the browser's ~eval~ function). The REPL works on mobile phones. A simple dark mode is available. There's not much more to say about it.

* PhoneticAlphabet.html

This file can be used to convert text to the NATO / ITU phonetic alphabet and read to the user by using the Web Speech API.
